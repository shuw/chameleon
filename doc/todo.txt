 Done

Comments, load them, and the people who made them, hide them after a while, show them one by one
Remove pictures from search term when dragged

 Pri 0 - doing next
*******************************************
Heterogeneous objects: 
	Try books from Amazon
Transient focus: 
	When focusing on an object, fade to gray objects not in focus, and stop them from moving



Create dockable pane to manage objects

Create InteractableObject as a parent class of ModelObject

·         Create some debug code to ensure that layout vertice count is sane

·         Comments

o   CommentLoader should re-use code by SearchBox to attach comments

o   Remove comment when person is dragged away

o   Create attach metaphor in WorldObject

·         Photos

o   Double click action to get higher resolution

·         Investigate sluggishness after search term has found a few photos

o   Repro: Drag SearchTerm around while it is updating

·         Do not zoom to objects from start menu, drop in center of world

·         Don’t show warning when deleting objects (NeoGraphics might handle this differently)

·         Documentation with screenshots and youtube video

o   Readme

·         Don’t show comments until profile picture is loaded

·         Develop logo and icon, integrate into jar file

 

·         Sorting algorithm for mutual friends, friends part

·         Missing icon for ensemble

·         Undo operation for layouts not working

·         Enable save / load layouts

·         Enabling elastic layout erases the vertice locks, need to reenable locks every time

·         Cannot drag photos into windows

·         Escape key should not exit full screen view

·         Highlight relationships of person when clicked upon

o   Find path between two people

·         Default to high rendering quality

·         Reduce vibrations in animation

·         Rotation of person causes it’s photo’s to rotate as well.

o   Overide setRotation to only rotate the person icon

·         Create the idea of an “attached” object that does not inherit transformation but moves along with another object (attachTo())


Improve force mass function
Make searchterm anchorable

Type Flickr SearchTerm queries inline

Flickr friend loader needs to be attached to an object, it needs to be destroyed when object is destroyed.

Increase minimum distance around photos, add size property to ElasticObject

Do multi word search

Consider create edges explicitly in ElasticGround rather than implicitly through PXEdge creation


Fade in comments as well.

Support the case where one person comments twice, make sure the comments don't overlap

Work on first-run experience, adding new objects should not overlap, focus on new objects created through file menu

Add "exit" to file menu

Anchor positions of photos when they are dragged into the world?

Only have one comment runner at once,
Investigate weird behavior where entire photo collage is dragged with photos.


Navigate search results using click

Bulge lines when clicked upon

Make task messages world objects

Use PPositionPathActivity to animate objects
	Elliptical path for object animation paths
	
Move relationship loading to PersonObject
	add counter to show number of friends loaded / how many total

Regular expression matching does not work with some characters

Use popup messages to notify user of objects events

Load friends from Person object, store friends there

Open up social network in new window, show person's profile pic in window header

Figure out a way to layer objects algorthimically
	Perhaps when a person is brought to the front, 
	all his 1-st degree friends (within certain visual distance)
	are brought to the front as well
	

Rendering html in Photo descriptions 

Show warning message when source has no photos

Actions
	get comments, bring in new people from sn network
	expand social network

Get buttons for photo collage working

Create a queue of network objects and close stale objects to open new ones
